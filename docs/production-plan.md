# Desktop preview plan

Reviewed 2026-09-06. The standing goal remains production readiness for Agent
Commons, with desktop first and a hosted service later. Progress is judged by
complete user workflows and release evidence, not the number of hardened
mutation paths. Routine refactors and recovery work should support these
milestones or address a demonstrated defect.

## Decisions in force

- Electron, distributed directly as signed/notarized Apple Silicon and Intel ZIPs.
- Preserve sign-in and personal MCP tokens across relaunch using an encrypted
  device signing root protected by macOS Keychain (approved 2026-09-06).
- Keep the HTTP/SSE contract portable to the later hosted service.
- Verify, review, commit, and push each completed checkpoint directly to main.
- Ask before selecting an updater policy or materially widening the supported
  external integration scope.

## Progress and next milestones

| Milestone | Evidence and remaining work |
| --- | --- |
| Trustworthy local host | Sandboxed Electron, clean first run, SQLite, managed backups/restore, provider-key lifecycle, and native recovery are built. The signing root now persists separately from product data; packaged acceptance covers sign-in, token recovery, and a completed conversation across a full restart. |
| Useful first conversation | Provider onboarding and the Messages transport are built. Local text reaches both endpoint and Session transports as whole files (64 KiB per file, 128 KiB total, first 24 items), with shared-plan UI and one input snapshot reused through the tool loop. Browser/native intake now shares source/configuration format recognition and strict whole UTF-8 decoding; a real browser file chooser proves source text reaches the endpoint fixture. Image/document/folder/remote-source input remains the FWD-9 gap. Provider proof is deterministic protocol evidence, not paid-model acceptance. |
| Useful external work | Connector/MCP execution has a real consent and authorization boundary but release fulfilment remains unconfigured. Select and deliver one real adapter and discovery workflow before broadening the catalog. Repository content/git and some imported artifact renderers remain declared fixtures. |
| Distributable preview | The paired release verifier is built; both architecture candidates still need actual signing/notarization credentials, native execution evidence, and an authenticated download destination. A green browser CI run does not prove a signed release exists. |
| Hosted service | Preserve the boundary now; defer anonymous indexing, broad cross-device polish, and deployment-specific tenancy operations until the desktop preview's core workflows pass. |

## Checkpoint criteria

Each milestone records its implementation and behavioral locks in the spec
ledger, proves a relevant regression fails, runs the full verifier, and reviews
the diff before landing. Native changes additionally run the packaged executable
smoke; UI changes receive signed-in live review. Real-provider acceptance must
be identified separately from tests using the deterministic Messages fixture.

Revisit this order when a core journey reveals a blocker or the owner changes a
product direction. Do not treat the remaining partial cross-device requirement
as an instruction to harden every mutation before shipping useful desktop work.

The latest local-text checkpoint removes basename-based attachment loss:
same-named selected files now keep independent snapshots through preview,
reload, model input, and removal. Adapter regression tests were observed failing
before the fix, and a browser chooser walk verifies the complete text journey.
The full verifier passed all five lanes (277 browser tests), and packaged
Electron verification passed. Packaged attachment acceptance now crosses the
native reader and IPC into the actual renderer, endpoint transport, durable
conversation, and independent removal. Two same-name files retain their exact
IDs and bodies across relaunch after both source files are deleted. This phase
fixtures only the native dialog result and model response; the actual OS dialog
still needs manual review. It uses a separate profile because Playwright's
Electron launcher adds mock-keychain switches; real OS-backed storage acceptance
remains in the unchanged ordinary executable smoke. An intentional mutation of
the packaged native text return was observed failing at the rendered preview.
Shared-preview review remains unavailable while the owner's Mac is locked.

## Open verification follow-ups

One full local run of `e2e/agent-proposal-verdict.spec.ts` observed a Review
button click without its dialog remaining open. Ten focused traced walks passed;
the cause is unconfirmed, not fixed by that repetition. First-failure tracing
(`E2E_TRACE=1 npm run verify`) is now available to capture a recurrence without
adding retries or extending timeouts. Keep this observation open until evidence
identifies its cause.

A traced full run also observed the phone drawer stop accepting a session-row
click while the main pane intercepted it. Five focused walks with explicit
drawer-state assertions and the next complete run passed, but no runtime cause
or fix has been established. Keep this observation open too. The diagnostic run
separately proved that parallel Playwright processes shared trace scratch space;
each shard now owns its output directory, and the subsequent traced full run
completed without artifact collisions.
